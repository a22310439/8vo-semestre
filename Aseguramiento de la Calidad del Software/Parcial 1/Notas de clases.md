## Experts Prefer Simpler Slutions
"Every design problem has multiple, if not infinite, ways of solving it. Experts strongly prefer simpler solutions over more complex ones, for they know that such solutions are easier to understand and change in the future. Simplicity is so important to them that they often continue to search for simpler solutions even after they have a solution in hand." 

## Experts Solve Simpler Problems First
"Experts do not try to think about everything at once. When faced with a complex problem, experts often solve a simpler problem first, one that addresses the same core issue in a more straightforward form. In doing so, they can generate candidate solutions that are incomplete, but provide insight for solving the more complex problem that they actually have to solve"


## Experts Divide And Conquer
"Experts know when and how to break down a complex problem into smaller problems that can be solved independently. In addressing the parts, however, they do not forget about the whole: they reflect on the relationships between parts. When what emerges in solving one part affects other parts, they make adjustments. Indeed, they sometimes repartition the whole problem and solution as a result."
## Experts Design Elegant  Abstractions
While all developers create abstractions, experts design them. A good abstraction makes evident what is important, both in what it does and how it does it. Through a single lens, it communicates the problem it solves and the machinery of its solution. Experts are not satisfied with just any abstraction, they deliberately seek elegant abstractions through which complex structures can be introduced, understood, and referred to efficiently.
